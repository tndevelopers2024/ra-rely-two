## 4. Footer — Social & Newsletter
- [ ] **LinkedIn Company URL:** `https://www.linkedin.com/company/[approved-linkedin-handle]` (Found in `Footer.tsx`). Currently labelled "(placeholder)" in the UI — remove that label once the real URL is in place, or delete the link entirely if there is no company page.
- [ ] **Newsletter Delivery Endpoint:** The "Finance Operations Notes" signup form in `Footer.tsx` currently prevents submit and stores nothing. Connect it to the approved email platform (or remove the form) before launch, and confirm the consent wording meets the Spam Act 2003 requirements.
