    q: 'Can Rely work with our existing accountant?',

    q: 'Do we need to outsource our entire finance function?',
    a: 'No. Many engagements begin with one priority process, such as accounts receivable or management reporting.',

    a: 'Initial platforms include Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks Online, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft 365, and reporting tools.',

    q: 'Will Rely make payments from our bank account?',
    a: 'Rely may prepare payment information under the agreed process, but final approval and release always remain with authorised client personnel.',
