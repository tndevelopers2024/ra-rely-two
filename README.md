## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Enquiry email delivery
Copy the SMTP section in `.env.example` into `.env.local`, and set the mailbox provider's host, port, username, password (or app password), and authorised sender. Port 587 uses required STARTTLS; port 465 uses TLS from connection start. Add the same variables to the hosting environment.

Contact and review requests are emailed to `info@relyadvisory.com.au` and `rogerm@relyadvisory.com.au`. Roger's address stays server-side. Replies go to the visitor's email. The forms report a failure if SMTP is unconfigured or the server does not accept both recipients; they no longer simulate delivery. Verify real inbox delivery after configuring the mailbox.

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
